# Requirements for the Final Project in WebDev 3

The final project will be a system that you will create based on what you have submitted as a Project Specification Document for your Midterm Project.  The system does not need to be complex as long as it complies with the functionalities specified in the Project Specifications Document. Here are the guidelines of the Final Project:

1. The system should be stored in a Github repository and you should add my personal github as a contributor/maintainer.
2. Every meeting, you and your group members will develop your project and we will have a Daily Stand Up of each group through Google Meet (same link). You will be discussing what you need to do during the class and should be able to finish most of the task requirements by the end of the meet.
3. A Daily Stand Up document should be submitted every 2 weeks as a proof that you have worked on your tasks for the 2 weeks of our class. This will also constitute your exercises for the class.
4. A Progress Report will also be submitted every week and should contain information about the progress of the system as well as if there are delayed tasks. This will constitute as the quiz for the class.
5. The Daily Stand Up document and the progress report will be submitted by the group leader not later than Friday noon of the week where the document(s) are supposed to be sent (e.g. if the document is due every two weeks, the submission should be up until Friday noon of the second week).
6. Each member should contribute to the development of the system and will be checked by using commit logs written by each of the members. It should clearly indicate the things that was done and should be committed every end of the class.
7. The leader should be the one to merge the changes of each of the members. I will discuss how this is done via our discussion of Git.
8. The presentation of the system will be on the Finals week (December 13 and 15). Everyone should be able to present each of their modules and demonstrate the functionalities. The presentation itself will constitute the Final Exam of the class.
9. A rubric of the final presentation will be presented to everyone a week before the presentation. This will be the basis of scoring by the panelist.
10. More details of the presentation will be available as the deadline nears.

Any failure to submit or delay in submission is a deduction for that report for the entire group.
